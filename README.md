# AI-Debater
Inital idea of this project was to utilize Open AI's api to create a *debater* and a *moderator*. Each serving his own purpose ( Debating with the user and rating message afterwards for fallacies, overal argumentation etc. respectively )

However i soon ran into an issue with open AI, that i did not manage to solve. This led to me migrating from Open AI to my local AI - this was harder than expected.
